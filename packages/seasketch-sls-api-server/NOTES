x show function name in header
x display sketches on the map and zoom to them when selecting examples
x fix navigation
x enable sketching
basics done but need to improve feel
remove sketches after picking examples
x make sure case of no-examples works okay
internalize some of the results and client fetching to ReportSidebar
make sure ReportSidebar has some really good PropTypes and docs
x check that local hosting works and fix any issues with ReportSidebar
x ensure that entire creation process works

# enhancements
x get hot-module replacement working in api-server? might make it easier to do these enhancements
make sure projects without clients are rendered properly
change organization of top-level

      Cost (this month, YTD)
    List of projects (name, last updated[sort by], # functions, # clients)
    Latest invocations (project, function, requested_at, duration or eta, payload_size, flag for ec2 runs, memory_size)
    Recent Errors (last 10)(project, function, requested_at, log message that contains error)


  What you need to know about:

    Projects
      name
      when they were updated
      how many clients, functions they have
      what seasketch projects they are associated with
      github repo
      asset urls
      s3 bucket

      Clients
        how many tabs
        how large in file size
          maybe link to webpack visualization?
        what projects use them

x why is it taking so long to be notified of eta?
x make failures render better
  x icons/colors
  x do something about empty results
x add "Copy Link", "Contact Support", "View Project" to actions at the top
x add progress bar with countdown to report sidebar
x add means to view logs and errors from report sidebar
x add something that finalizes logs
xbetter workflow for deployment
xdeploy all assets in dist rather than by name
xmodify testSh to do something simpler
SLS_LOGS_COMPLETE gets shoved to the top of the list and replaces lambda logs... why?
also, why do you get a start log but not the invocationId ones, which must have been processed?
xSLS_LOG_COMPLETE and SLS_LOGS_COMPLETE are both in my list. uh oh
why does opening report details sometime fail?
adapt zonation project and verify it works
make sure status page renders well
  add ec2 worker details (to schema and InvocationStatus, particularly timeout and launchTemplate)
make sure invocations list renders well
implement scroll locking behavior without container
x update queries for recent-invocations to include outstanding requests at the top
add watcher script to enforce timeouts
calculate cost for ec2 runs
xhandle cases where ec2 workers timeout. Doesn't seem to record a failure or log message



later...
send log events rather than the whole status
make an implementation with multiple tabs
multiple sources in one tab
multiple reports in one module
different geometry types


# deployment
spin up ec2 instance
install/figure-out-how-to-deal-with postgres
pm2?
dotenv?
setup domain


# seasketch integration
make report-base with @seasketch-sls-geoprocessing/client
add admin interface to specify sketch->report associations
conditionally load report-base
api-server connection to mongo
make sure it all works
verify cacheing
cross-browser testing
